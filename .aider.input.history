+https://github.com/sabelosimelane/prompt_sail Help me copy the read MD for this project as I have cloned it, I've forked it actually and I'm writing a better version. So just add maybe on top that this change to so include everything that's there but also add that this is a improved version using a Java back end and it's going to be maintained a bit more because the older version, the older repo was not being taken care of. But my pull requests were not being accepted, right there in a polite way though, but just making sure that this one appears to be a better version and it will work for most people.

+We still want to explain what the project is about, right? So I was hoping that you would have what you wrote here as a preface and then still add everything that's there. I will then tweak it as I make changes to align.
